# CMOS_LEVEL_SHIFTERS
CMOS low-power level shifters are circuits used to interface signals between different voltage domains in a multi-voltage system. They are essential in modern integrated circuits (ICs), which often operate with different supply voltages to optimize power consumption and performance.
